<h1 id="#post1">Configinit on AWS</h1>

<p class="datetext"> October 15, 2016

                    </p>
<p class="maintext">
In this blog post let's have fun with configinit to automate provisioning FreeBSD instances on AWS EC2.  You can check out configinit <a href="http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2013-12-09-FreeBSD-EC2-configinit.html"> here </a> which I highly recommed doing before reading the rest of this post.
</p>

<p class="maintext_indent">
This demo will cover leveraging configinit on FreeBSD to easily install arbitrary packages while configuring a SaltStack client (a popular configuration management engine) upon first boot.  Hopefully I'll illustrate that a simple, clearly defined tool like configinit is capable of pretty powerful system automation while also being flexible.  This is also known as “the Unix way” for those following along at home.
</p>

<p class="maintext_indent">
For starters here is our example configinit script which will be defined as user data when instatiating a new FreeBSD EC2 instance:
</p>

<pre>
#!/bin/sh
# This sed line updates the list of packages to install on first boot
sed -i .dist 's/awscli/awscli\ py27-salt\ bash\ tmux\ sudo\ vim-lite/g'  /etc/rc.conf
# Define hostname
echo "hostname="webapp0.iad.nomadlogic.org"" >> /etc/rc.conf

# SaltStack agent configuration
mkdir -p /usr/local/etc/salt/

echo "master: 10.11.12.13" >> /usr/local/etc/salt/minion
echo "hash_type: sha512" >> /usr/local/etc/salt/minion

echo "salt_minion_enable="YES"" >> /etc/rc.conf

</pre>
<p class="maintext_indent">
The above example is a simple /bin/sh script which is executed by your new EC2 instance on first boot.  It illustrates that you can not only install packages on first boot, but also automate standing up your configuration management engine (SaltStack minion in this example) as well.  Because this is "user data" that is passed by EC2 it is very simple to automate deployment of new instances using configinit.  For example I've been able to template out my user data shell script (similar the one above), and have my inventory define settings like "hostname" as well as my package list.  Then my EC2 provisioning script will pass the customized configinit script to AWS ensuring my client is defined correctly.  SaltStack takes care of the rest once we have this base config deployed, and I've managed to lower the amount of data I have to keep track of in the process.
</p>

<p class="maintext_indent">
Colin Percival configured the FreeBSD EC2 images in the AWS Marketplace to have configinit enabled by default which is helpful.  Let's take a look at the base /etc/rc.conf from his image, the first line enables configinit followed by installing the public key we defined when instantiating this instance.  We also configure swapspace, and the key for logging:
</p>

<pre>
ec2_configinit_enable=YES
ec2_fetchkey_enable=YES
ec2_ephemeralswap_enable=YES
ec2_loghostkey_enable=YES
firstboot_freebsd_update_enable=YES
firstboot_pkgs_enable=YES
growfs_enable="YES"
ifconfig_DEFAULT="SYNCDHCP"
sshd_enable="YES"
firstboot_pkgs_list="awscli"

</pre>
<p class="maintext_indent">
I should note one other feature of the FreeBSD EC2 images, which I’ll illustrate bellow.  When you first boot a FreeBSD EC2 instance it will perform a freebsd-update (another utility written by Colin) to ensure your new system is fully patched against the RELEASE branch you are deploying, as well as ensuring pkg is bootstrapped.  Both of those tasks are accomplished via the first two firstboot_* directives.  This saves some work as an admin, as I don’t have to configure my CloudInit script to perform an upgrade myself.  Having sane default behaviour is an added bonus in such a hostile environment like AWS.
</p>

<p class="maintext_indent">
I would also like to note a couple other cool things.  The line "growfs_enable" will automatically increase the root partition to use the full size of the disk we defined when creating the EC2 instance which is handy when using EBS root vols. Finally there is the firstboot_pkgs_list line, as you'll remember from above, is where we execute a sed command against to list a baseline set of packages.  I find it really handy to have a simple method of defining which packages I want installed on boot, especially when it is as clear as this.
</p>

<p class="maintext_indent">
So let’s show this in action shall we?

<p class="maintext_indent">
So pretty normal boot process and you'll notice right after network is finished being configured cloudinit kicks-in installing our defined packages.  Also, as I mentioned earlier you'll notice that we also execute freebsd-update which ensures we are all patched up.  I've successfuly used FreeBSD + configinit + salt-stack to deploy multi-tier web stacks on AWS in a more or less fully automated manner.   Hopefully this demo gives you all some good ideas on how to exploit automation techniques like this for your infrastructure.
