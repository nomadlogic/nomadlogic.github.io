                <h1 id="#post1">Installing OpenSMTPD On FreeBSD</h1>
                        <p class="datetext"> Jun 9, 2016 </p>
                        <p class="maintext">
                        This blog post is hopefully a usefull set of breadcrumbs for configuring your own OpenSMTPD based mail server on FreeBSD.  My configuration is prety standard, so maybe it'll be useful for others who host their own email.  The basic configuration will consist of the following components:
                        </p>

                        <pre>   
FreeBSD 10.3-RELEASE
OpenSMTPD v5.7.3p2
OpenSMTPD-extras
Dovecot IMAP
                        </pre>

                        <p class="maintext_indent">
                        For this exercise we will install all software via the FreeBSD <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=pkg&apropos=0&sektion=7&manpath=FreeBSD+10.3-RELEASE+and+Ports&arch=default&format=html">pkg(7)</a> utility.  As mentioned earlier my requirements are pretty simple.  I have a couple local users who I trust who have accounts on my system.  I want to provide IMAP access for mail storage, and I want to allow them to send email via my system as well.  My previous configuration was based on Dovecot and Postfix, which works great.  Although since I am shuffling my personal servers around I'm taking the opportunity to test out OpenSMTPD as my primary MTA.
                        </p>
                                               
                        <p class="maintext_indent">
                                                First lets get the easy bits out of the way - let's install the OpenSMTPD packages.  I am going to assume you know how to install and perform basic systems administration tasks on FreeBSD.  If you don't and would like to give FreeBSD a spin check out my ISP <a href="https://arpnetworks.com/vps" target="blank">ARP Networks</a>.  They have FreeBSD VPS servers reasonably priced.  So, let's first install OpenSMTPD and the OpenSMTPD-extras package via the pkg(7) utility:
                        </p>

                        <pre>

% sudo pkg install opensmtpd opensmtpd-extras

                        <p class="maintext_indent">
                                                Wow, the openstmpd-extras package pulls in a lot of extra dependencies.  I struggled for a while contemplating rebuilding this package to not include the MySQL and PostgreSQL client packages as I don't have a use-case for RDBMS backends.  I eventually decided that the overhead of managing a custom repository was not worth the bloat of having client libraries for these systems on my mail server.  I am also hoping the FreeBSD packaging team will do a better job than me at tracking security vulns on this software than I would be able to do.
                        </p>
                                                
                                                <p class="maintext_indent">
                                                Next I needed to manually create some directories and adjust their permissions for OpenSMTPD like so.  In theory this is done by the package at install time, but this was not the case for me.
                                                </p>
                                                <pre>

% mkdir -p /var/spool/smtpd/{corrupt,incoming,purge,queue,temporary}
% sudo chmod 0711 /var/spool/smtpd/
% sudo chmod 0700 /var/spool/smtpd/*
% sudo chown _smtpq /var/spool/smtpd/*
                                                </pre>


                        <p class="maintext_indent">
                        Once I created the appropriate directory structure for OpenSMTPD's mail spool I went ahead and configured /etc/rc.conf to completely disable sendmail(8) and enable OpenSMTPD:
                        </p>
                                                <pre>

# Mailer Config
# first completely disable sendmail
sendmail_enable="NO"
sendmail_submit_enable="NO"
sendmail_outbound_enable="NO"
sendmail_msp_queue_enable="NO"
# enable opensmtpd
smtpd_enable="YES"
                                                </pre>
                                                <p class="maintext_indent">
                                                At this point I was then able to configure OpenSMTPD, using the manpage for smtpd.conf(5) as reference.  Read the man page, this is just for illustrative purposes!  For example, the man documents how to generate selfsigned SSL keys which I will not cover here.  Here is my config file with some helpful documentation. 
                                                </p>
                                                <pre>

% cat /usr/local/etc/mail/smtpd.conf
# This is the smtpd server system-wide configuration file.
# See smtpd.conf(5) for more information.

# Macros
pub_int = "vtnet0"

# PKI config
pki mail.nomadlogic.org certificate "/usr/local/etc/mail/
ssl/mail.mydomain.org.crt"
pki mail.nomadlogic.org key "/usr/local/etc/mail/ssl/mail.
mydomain.org.key"

# Listen Rules, loopback no auth but encrypt/auth on public
listen on lo0
listen on $pub_int tls pki mail.mydomain.org auth

# If you edit the file, you have to run "smtpctl update 
table aliases"
table aliases file:/etc/mail/aliases

# accept local messages and deliver to users maildir
accept from any for domain "mydomain.org" alias <aliases> deliver to maildir

# allow outgoing emails
accept for any relay
                                                </pre>
                                                <p class="maintext_indent">
                                                So now I have configured SMTP daemon and I am able to start smtpd and verify in the logs that everything is in place.  Next steps are configuring Dovecot and doing actual testing.  Stay tuned to future posts on that phase.
                                                </p>
