There are three files contained in this directory:

- ec2_create.py:
-- A simple python script to read in the values defined
   in ec2_config.json and instantiate a EC2 instance.
   We tag the instance as well, register it with Route53
   and report back how to ssh into the node.

- ec2_config.json:
-- A simple JSON configuration file that is currently
   static, but can be templated out using Ninja to set
   up an arbitrary number of nodes.  That is currently
   a TODO item.

- freebsd-user-data.txt:
-- A simple configinit script that configures a node to
   act as a salt-stack minion, while also setting up IPv6
   as well as other basic bootstrap tasks.  This is supplied
   as user-data via the ec2_create.py script.
